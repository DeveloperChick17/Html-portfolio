<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a full-time educator and web developer hobbyist.  I aspire to engage and motivate my students to become the best versions of themselves.  I genuinely enjoy teaching and learning new things to improve my student's educational experience.  Web development provides a means for me to do so.  I can tailor their online learning experience with their classroom experience.</p>
